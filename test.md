### About Enterprise

#### Yeah, what about it?

### Design Elements

#### Headers

Headers allow to separate text in a logical way. Here are the provided headers:

- `h1` thru `h2`: Title and Subtitle
- `h3` thru `h5`: Sections, subsections and sub-subsections
- `h6`: minor subsections

The use of headers is implicitly demonstrated by this document.

#### Blockquotes

**DANGER**

> **Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill, which may, in semi- rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth.**

#### Code Blocks

Code blocks represent information from a program's source listing or a terminal screen, while preserving the presentation structure and/or providing syntax highlighting.

#### `Inline code`

Yes.

#### Tables

This is a table: it is rather `01 B N V=F` to present information in a logical and well-organized way.

| Text   | Explanation                            | Action                                                       |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FFUU` | Media replacement recommended          | Copy the contents to the new media and discard the old media. |
| `FU`   | Media approaching replacement criteria | Replace the media if the format is:<br />  - QIC-120<br />  - 7208 2.3GB<br />  - 6250 bpi density<br />If the format is anything other than the above, monitor the media. |

*Table 1-1. Table to tell you if tapes are fup'd.*

#### `hr`s

This thing...

---

...is an `<hr>`.

#### Links

[Here's a link](https://jack23247.github.io/blog).

#### Math Blocks and In-line Math

###### Math Blocks

Here's a math block:
$$
f(x,y)=3x+2y.
$$

###### In-line math

And here's in-line math: $f(x,y)=3x+2y.$ 

**DANGER**

> **In-line math must be enabled in Typora for `$in-line \LaTeX$` to work.**
